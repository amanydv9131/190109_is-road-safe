Question C:
Neural networks are designed to find patterns and are modeled considering human brain in mind. We use neural networks to basically fit non-linear models. Images have more features which can only be extracted using neural networks. For example, the first layer may detect the contrast and the next layer may detect the texture in the image. Therefore, we get more accurate results using neural networks.
