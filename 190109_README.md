Question C:
Neural networks are designed to find patterns and are modeled considering human brain in mind. We use neural networks to basically fit non-linear models. Images have more features which can only be extracted using neural networks. For example, the first layer may detect the contrast and the next layer may detect the texture in the image and the further you advance into the neural net, the more complex the features your nodes can recognize, since they recombine features from the previous layers giving us more accurate results.
